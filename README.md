# Password-Generator
### Explanation of the Code

The provided code creates a simple password generator application using `tkinter`, a popular Python library for GUI development. Below is a detailed explanation of each component of the code:

#### 1. **Imports**
   - `from tkinter import *`: Imports all classes and functions from the `tkinter` module.
   - `from tkinter.ttk import Combobox`: Imports the `Combobox` widget from `tkinter.ttk`.
   - `from tkinter import messagebox`: Imports the `messagebox` class for showing dialog boxes.
   - `import string, random`: Imports the `string` and `random` modules for generating random passwords.

#### 2. **Root Window Setup**
   ```python
   root = Tk()
   root.geometry("500x500")
   root.title("Gaurav Password Generator")
   root.config(bg="beige")
   ```
   - Creates the main window of the application.
   - Sets its size to 500x500 pixels.
   - Sets the title of the window.
   - Sets the background color to beige.

#### 3. **Password Generation Function**
   ```python
   def password_generate():
       try:
           length_password = solidboss.get()
           small_letters = string.ascii_lowercase
           capital_letters = string.ascii_uppercase
           digits = string.digits
           special_character = string.punctuation
           all_lists = []
           all_lists.extend(list(small_letters))
           all_lists.extend(list(capital_letters))
           all_lists.extend(list(digits))
           all_lists.extend(list(special_character))
           random.shuffle(all_lists)
           password.set("".join(all_lists[0:length_password]))
       except:
           messagebox.askretrycancel("A problem has Been Occured", "Please try again")
   ```
   - Retrieves the desired password length from the `solidboss` variable.
   - Combines lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters into one list.
   - Shuffles the combined list and generates a password of the specified length.
   - Updates the `password` variable with the generated password.
   - Displays an error message if an exception occurs.

#### 4. **Label and Combobox for Password Length**
   ```python
   all_no = {"1":"1","2":"2","3":"3","4":"4","5":"5","6":"6","7":"7","8":"8","9":"9","10":"10",
    "11":"11","12":"12","13":"13","14":"14","15":"15","16":"16","17":"17","18":"18","19":"19","20":"20",}

   Title = Label(root, text="Gaurav Password Generator", bg="beige", fg="black", font=("futura", 15, "bold"))
   Title.pack(anchor="center", pady="20px")

   length = Label(root, text="Select the Length of Your Password:-", fg="darkgreen", bg="beige", font=("ubuntu", 12))
   length.place(x="20px", y="70px")
   
   solidboss = IntVar()
   Selector = Combobox(root, textvariable=solidboss, state="readonly",)
   Selector['values'] = [l for l in all_no.keys()]
   Selector.current(7)
   Selector.place(x="250px", y="72px")
   ```
   - Creates and places a title label and a label for selecting password length.
   - Creates a `Combobox` for selecting the length of the password. It uses the `solidboss` variable to store the selected length and populates it with numbers from 1 to 20.

#### 5. **Generate Button**
   ```python
   def on_enter(e):
       generate_btn['bg'] = "blue"
       generate_btn['fg'] = "white"

   def on_leave(e):
       generate_btn['bg'] = "orange"
       generate_btn['fg '] = "black"

   generate_btn = Button(root, text="Generate Password", bg="orange", fg="black", font=("ubuntu", 15), cursor="hand2", command=password_generate)
   generate_btn.bind("<Enter>", on_enter)
   generate_btn.bind("<Leave>", on_leave)
   generate_btn.pack(anchor="center", pady="50px")
   ```
   - Creates a button to generate the password. It changes color when the mouse pointer hovers over it or leaves it.
   - Binds `on_enter` and `on_leave` functions to handle mouse hover effects.

#### 6. **Result Label and Entry Field**
   ```python
   result_label = Label(root, text="Generate Password Here:-", bg="beige", fg="darkgreen", font=("ubuntu", 12))
   result_label.place(x="20px", y="160px")

   password = StringVar()
   password_final = Entry(root, textvariable=password, state="readonly", fg="blue", font=("ubuntu", 15))
   password_final.place(x="200px", y="160px")
   ```
   - Creates a label and an entry field to display the generated password.

### Running the Code on Another PC

To run this application on another PC, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**
   - Ensure that Python is installed on the target PC. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Save the Code**
   - Save the provided code to a file named `password_generator.py` or another `.py` file of your choice.

3. **Install Required Libraries**
   - The code uses only standard libraries (`tkinter`, `string`, `random`), so no additional packages are required.

4. **Run the Application**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where your `password_generator.py` file is saved.
   - Execute the script with the following command:
     ```bash
     python password_generator.py
     ```
   - The application window should open, and you can interact with it to generate passwords.

5. **Troubleshooting**
   - **Python Version**: Make sure you are using Python 3.x as `tkinter` is included with Python's standard library.
   - **Permissions Issues**: Ensure that the script has permission to access the necessary system resources.

By following these steps, you should be able to run the password generator application on any PC with Python installed. If you encounter specific issues, let me know!
